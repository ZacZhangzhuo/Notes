A linear park is proposed for Wuhan, with the Dazhimen station being the first entrance. The designer will make full use of its internal space without damaging the structure of this historical building.
 
This project explores an interface called ‘rational sketcher’ with its ‘expert system’ providing generative advice so that the freehand sketches can obtain a descriptive consideration and rationality. After that, a pen plotter could compile the auto-generated drawings, which discovers the potential of CNC in CAD. Through the collaboration of software and hardware, this sketcher could act as a real participant in the design process and provide new formal potentials.
